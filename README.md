# garbage-classification using CNN
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to classify different types of garbage into six categories using images. It helps in understanding how machine learning models can support waste management systems.

# Project Overview
Goal: Classify garbage images into:

Cardboard
Glass
Metal
Paper
Plastic
Trash

# Method: 
We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build the model.

# Tools: 
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and Google Colab / VS Code

# What I Learned
Basics of AI and Machine Learning

How to work with image datasets

How to build and train a CNN model

How to test and improve a modelâ€™s performance

# Dataset Details
The dataset contains images of different types of garbage.

Each type has its own folder (Ex: plastic/, glass/, etc.)

Total: ~2500+ images, all resized to 128x128 pixels
