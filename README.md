# Garbage Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Welcome to the Garbage Classification project repository! This project aims to classify garbage images into two classes: organic and recyclable, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Overview

The proliferation of waste poses significant challenges to environmental sustainability. Proper waste classification is crucial for effective waste management and recycling initiatives. In this project, we leverage CNNs to automatically classify garbage images into organic and recyclable categories.

## Dataset

We utilized the "Waste Classification with CNN" dataset available on Kaggle, which comprises a collection of images representing various types of garbage. The dataset contains images of organic waste, such as food scraps and plant-based materials, as well as recyclable waste, including cardboard, glass, metal, paper, and plastic.
